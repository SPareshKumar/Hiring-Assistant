# üß† Hiring Assistant ‚Äì AI-Powered Technical Interview Chatbot

Hiring Assistant is an AI-driven, context-aware technical interview chatbot built using Google Gemini Pro. It simulates an intelligent interviewer that dynamically generates personalized, role-specific technical questions based on the candidate‚Äôs profile, experience level, and responses.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to streamline the technical interview process by automating the most time-consuming aspect ‚Äî generating relevant, thoughtful, and challenging interview questions tailored to each candidate. It conducts adaptive interviews, analyzes responses in real time, and follows up with deeper questions, simulating the expertise of a senior technical interviewer.

### Key Capabilities:
- Collects and validates candidate information interactively.
- Analyzes tech stack and experience to generate a candidate profile.
- Crafts unique, scenario-based questions based on seniority, desired role, and real-world use cases.
- Dynamically adapts follow-up questions using response analysis.
- Stores complete interview session data for review.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- A valid Google Gemini API Key
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SPareshKumar/Hiring-Assistant.git
   cd Hiring-Assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   ```

5. **Run the chatbot**:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Guide

Once the bot is running, it will:
1. Greet the user and collect key information (name, email, experience, tech stack, etc.).
2. Analyze the candidate's background to determine complexity and role-specific focus.
3. Ask technical questions tailored to your expertise.
4. Analyze your answers in real time, offering follow-up questions or diving deeper as needed.
5. Save the entire session in a structured JSON file for later review.

To exit the session anytime, simply type `exit` or `quit`.

## üß∞ Technical Details

### Core Libraries & Tools:
- `google-generativeai` ‚Äì Google Gemini Pro integration
- `datetime`, `json`, `re` ‚Äì standard data handling
- `dotenv` ‚Äì for managing API keys
- Custom `SentimentAnalyzer` ‚Äì for response tone analysis (optional module)

### Design & Architecture:
- Modular class-based architecture for clarity and extensibility.
- Finite state machine design to manage chatbot conversation states.
- Response analysis layer to guide dynamic question generation and follow-ups.
- JSON output logger for saving structured candidate data.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Prompt Design Philosophy

Crafting effective prompts was central to this project. Prompts were engineered to:
- Encourage scenario-based, real-world questions (e.g., ‚ÄúHow would you scale X‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Adapt question style based on experience: junior (implementation), mid (design), senior (architecture), expert (strategic decisions)
- Emulate human interviewers by using multi-step evaluation logic (e.g., checking tech stack, analyzing prior answers)
- Leverage role-specific focus areas (e.g., DevOps asks CI/CD, Frontend asks about performance, etc.)

Prompts are detailed, contextual, and consistent ‚Äî ensuring questions feel both personalized and professional.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges & Solutions

### ‚ùå Challenge: Personalized, High-Quality Question Generation  
**Problem:** Generating deeply personalized questions that weren‚Äôt generic or repetitive was a core challenge.  
**Solution:** Implemented detailed prompt templates that dynamically integrated:  
- Tech stack  
- Experience level  
- Target position  
- Previous answers  
- Skill analysis from prior responses  
This allowed each question to build logically on the last, creating a unique flow per user.

### ‚ùå Challenge: Maintaining Question Diversity  
**Problem:** Risk of generating similar questions for overlapping tech stacks.  
**Solution:** Tracked technologies already covered and ensured each new question targeted an uncovered skill or angle. Also incorporated fallbacks to handle API failures and improve robustness.

### ‚ùå Challenge: Ensuring Relevance and Depth  
**Problem:** Sometimes questions were too surface-level.  
**Solution:** Incorporated response quality evaluation and follow-up strategies (e.g., deeper dive, clarification, or edge-case exploration) to maintain depth and nuance.
